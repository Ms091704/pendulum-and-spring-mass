# exploring of interesting problens involving driven oscillators/pendulums 
summarize exploration of interesting probkems and simpler variants that we can use to orient our understanding

## some intersting questions to explore
- how do we calculate the center of mass
  - ... and how do we approach this problem if its not rigid?
- can we understand the dynamics of the drivien rigid pendulum?
  - is there a closed-form solution?
- how do things change when the pendulum motin affects the drivers motion?

### driven rigid pendulum
**what do we know about penulum motion:**
- make strong statements about forces, torques, p/k energy
  - need to remind ourselves abour polar coordinates and angular motion
- what do we remember abour a pendulum
  - simple harmonic motion](_when_)
    - guess: between $\pm 90^{\circ}$?
