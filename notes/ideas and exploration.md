# exploring of interesting problens involving driven oscillators/pendulums 
summarize exploration of interesting probkems and simpler variants that we can use to orient our understanding

## some intersting questions to explore
- how do we calculate the center of mass
  - ... and how do we approach this problem if its not rigid?
- can we understand the dynamics of the drivien rigid pendulum?
  - is there a closed-form solution?
- how do things change when the pendulum motin affects the drivers motion?
